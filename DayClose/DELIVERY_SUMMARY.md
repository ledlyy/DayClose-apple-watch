## ⚠️ What's Not Included (By Design)

### Intentionally Excluded
- ❌ **Actual App Icon Graphics**: Placeholder configuration provided (needs design)
- ❌ **App Store Screenshots**: Need capture from physical devices (7 sizes)
- ❌ **Xcode Project File**: Need to create fresh (all sources provided)
- ❌ **Bundle ID Configuration**: Use placeholder or set your own
- ❌ **Developer Team ID**: Need your Apple Developer account

### Why These Are Missing
1. **App Icons**: Design is subjective; placeholder structure provided
2. **Screenshots**: Require your specific device and data
3. **Project File**: Better to create fresh for your environment
4. **IDs**: Personalized to your developer account

### Time to Complete These
- App Icons: 2-4 hours (design or commission)
- Screenshots: 1-2 hours (capture + annotate)
- Xcode Setup: 5 minutes (open Xcode, drag files)
- ID Configuration: 2 minutes (Xcode settings)

**Total**: ~1 day of work to go from delivered code to App Store submission.
