## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Privacy is not just a feature — it's the foundation of DayClose:

### Our Privacy Commitments
1. **No External Networking**: Zero `URLSession` or `Network` framework imports (verified by automated grep scanning)
2. **File-Level Encryption**: All mood data encrypted with `NSFileProtectionComplete`
3. **No Analytics**: No crash reporters, no usage telemetry, no tracking pixels
4. **No Third-Party SDKs**: Pure Apple frameworks only — every line of code is auditable
5. **Privacy Manifest**: Complete `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` with zero data collection declared

### Automated Privacy Verification
```bash
# Run our privacy audit script
./scripts/CI_VERIFY.sh

# Stage 6: Privacy Verification
# - Scans for URLSession usage (should be 0)
# - Checks for Network framework imports (should be 0)
# - Validates NSFileProtectionComplete in Core Data stack
# - Verifies PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy completeness
```

**Privacy Audit**: See [`docs/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`](docs/VALIDATION_REPORT.md) for full privacy verification report.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage
- **20+ Unit Tests**: Model validation, persistence, business logic
- **UI Test Suite**: Complete user flow validation
