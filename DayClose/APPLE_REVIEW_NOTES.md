## 🔒 Privacy Architecture

### **100% On-Device Data Storage**

**Critical for Review**: This app qualifies for Apple's **"Data Not Collected"** privacy label.

#### Verification Steps for Reviewer
1. **Enable Network Link Conditioner**: Settings → Developer → Network Link Conditioner → 100% Loss
2. **Use the app**: All features work without network
3. **Check Settings → Privacy → Analytics**: No crash reports sent

#### Technical Implementation
- **Core Data** with `NSPersistentStoreFileProtectionComplete` (see `PersistenceController.swift` line 45)
- **No networking imports**: Search codebase for `URLSession` → 0 results
- **No third-party SDKs**: Pure Apple frameworks only
- **PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy**: Declares `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes` as empty array

#### Code Evidence
```bash
# Verify zero networking code
grep -r "URLSession" "DayClose Watch App/" → 0 matches
grep -r "import Network" "DayClose Watch App/" → 0 matches
```

**Privacy Manifest**: `DayClose Watch App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`

## 🏥 HealthKit Usage

### Permission Scope
**Read-only access** to:
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
- Activity Energy Burned (for ring completion %)

### Why These Permissions?
Used **only for contextual insight generation**:
- "Your activity and wellness are in sync!" (when both mood and activity are high)
- "Your body might need extra rest tonight" (when mood is low and HRV suggests stress)

### User Control
- **Optional**: App works fully if HealthKit permission denied
- **Disableable**: Settings → "Use Health Data" toggle
- **Transparent**: Clear usage description in permission prompt

### Privacy Safeguards
- **No HealthKit writes**: Only read permissions requested
- **No raw data storage**: Only derived insights stored (e.g., "high activity")
- **On-device analysis**: All computation in `InsightsEngine.swift`
- **No Shortcuts exposure**: Health data never exposed via Siri/Shortcuts

**Code**: `Managers/HealthKitManager.swift`

✅ **Dynamic Type**: All text scales with system preferences  
✅ **Alternative Inputs**: Digital Crown, AssistiveTouch, standard buttons  
✅ **Haptic Feedback**: Non-visual confirmation of state changes  

### Testing Recommendations for Reviewer
1. **VoiceOver**: Settings → Accessibility → VoiceOver → Enable
   - Navigate app with swipe gestures
   - All buttons have descriptive labels
   - Mood selections announce emoji + text ("Good 😊")

2. **Dynamic Type**: Settings → Accessibility → Larger Text → Max size
   - All text remains readable
   - No truncation or overlap

3. **High Contrast**: Settings → Accessibility → Increase Contrast
   - UI elements remain distinguishable
   - Colors maintain sufficient contrast

**Report**: `docs/A11Y_REPORT.md` (WCAG calculations included)

## 🌐 Localization

### Supported Languages
- **English** (Base) - 60+ strings
- **Turkish** - 60+ strings (100% parity)

### Testing
Switch system language: Watch App → Language & Region → Turkish

**Files**: `Resources/Base.lproj/` and `Resources/tr.lproj/`

## 🎮 watchOS 11 Features

### Modern Interaction Patterns
- ✅ **Double Tap Gesture** (Series 9+/Ultra 2+): Quick confirm mood selection
- ✅ **Digital Crown Navigation**: Scroll through mood options
